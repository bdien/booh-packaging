This software requires for compiling:

- gtk >= 2.8
- devel of gtk
- ruby
- ruby-gettext >= 0.8.0
- ruby-gtk2 >= 0.12; notice:
  - ruby-gtk2 0.15.0, 0.17.0 and 0.18.1 should be avoided, they are known
    problematic versions
  - with ruby >= 1.8.7, ruby-gtk2 >= 0.18.0 should be used, otherwise
    crashes will occur
- devel of ruby-gnome2 (mkmf-gnome2.rb, rbgobject.h)
- devel of libexiv2 (and thus, g++)

    Note: theoretically, gtk and ruby-gtk2 are not needed if
    you're gonna use only the backend script (the only lost
    functionality is white balance correction which uses
    gdk_pixbuf). However, the GUI is an important part of this
    software and its use is encouraged (it helps a lot).

And for runtime:

- convert (from ImageMagick) - for photos thumbnails generation
- identify (from ImageMagick) - for photos captions
- exif - to show full formatted EXIF information from photos
- mplayer - for videos thumbnails generation
- ffmpeg (with mp3lame compiled in) - for generating embedded
  .flv videos, to use with flowplayer (may not be a hard require)
- gimp - for photos editing (may not be a hard require)
- mozilla-firefox - for showing albums in browser, and going on the
  web for tutorials (may not be a hard require)
- lftp - for uploading web-albums

        Compiling and Installing Quick Start

Type this as normal user:

 # ruby setup.rb config
 # ruby setup.rb setup
 # cd ext
 # ruby extconf.rb && make

And type this as superuser:

 $ ruby setup.rb install
 $ cd ext
 $ make install

If you want to package as normal user to another root:

 $ ruby_archdir=`ruby -rrbconfig -e "puts Config::CONFIG['sitearchdir']"`
 $ libdir=`ruby -rrbconfig -e "puts Config::CONFIG['sitelibdir']"`
 $ rm -rf ${buildroot}
 $ ruby setup.rb install --prefix=${buildroot}
 $ cd ext
 $ make install DESTDIR=${buildroot} libdir=${buildroot}${libdir} archdir=${buildroot}${ruby_archdir}

Note: it will install things in traditional directories plus
ruby_archdir and ruby_libdir.
Change FPATH in ${buildroot}/local/lib/site_ruby/1.8/booh/config.rb to suit your $buildroot

Find desktop stuff (.desktop entry and icons) for your menu/packaging system
in the destkop/ subdir.
