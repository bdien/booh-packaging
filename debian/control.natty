Description: Best static Web-Album generator or your money back, Humerus.
 Booh is a static Web-Album generator. It's a program that takes one or several
 series of photos and videos, and automatically build static web pages to browse
 them, creating thumbnails etc (you should see the results). It's comparable to
 bins, for example. There are already tons of such programs available, however,
 none satisfied me so far because I want all of these features:
 .
    * automatic rotation of portrait images thanks to information read
      in .jpg file (EXIF)
    * immediate display of images (preloading in browser) -
      waiting a couple of seconds between each image is very frustrating
    * keep position of "next/previous" hyperlinks in browser between images
    * video support (including thumbnailing)
    * clever use of the whole space of a typical browser window (definitely
      not good to scroll to see the bottom of portrait images - or, opposedly,
      using only 1/4 of the screen area for a landscape image seems a poor use
      of space)
    * themability
    * sub-albums support
    * remember end-user preferred size of thumbnails accross sub-albums
    * multi-processor support for thumbnails generation
    * smooth integration of panoramic images in thumbnails pages
    * a GUI both easy to use for newbies, and very powerful so that power users
      can input captions, rotate, reorder and remove images FAST (extensive use
      of keyboard shortcuts and mouse gestures)
