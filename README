                     [[  Booh  ]]

''The Web-Album of choice for discriminating Linux users''

Booh stands for Best web-album Of the world, Or your money back,
Humerus.

The acronyn sucks, however this is a tribute to Dragon Ball by
Akira Toriyama, where the last enemy beaten by heroes of Dragon
Ball is named "Boo". But there was already a free software
project called Boo, so this one will be it "Booh". Or whatever.

Ah, and this is free software under the GPL license version 2
(not "or upper"), by the way. 


Booh is a static Web-Album generator. It's a program that takes
one or several series of photos and videos, and automatically
build static web pages to browse them, creating thumbnails etc.

Check out booh's homepage for more information (just search for
"booh linux" in google, you should be fine with first match).


Highlights:

        backend:

- automatically rotates portrait images thanks to exif info
- great themability
- immediate display of next image (preloading of next images)
- keep position in browser between images (no page load between images)
- multiproc support (parallelize image creations)
- advanced videos support (thumbnail, embedded flash playback etc)
- correctly handle files and directories with spaces and non
  US-ASCII characters (even if I _don't_ advice you to store
  files with these)
- clever use of the whole space of a typical browser window
- cookie to remember the preferred size of thumbnails accross sub-albums
- subalbums support (images in any subdirectory depth)

        frontend:

- very advanced capabilities by keyboard shortcuts and mouse gestures
- input captions, rotate, reorder and remove images FAST

        classifier:

- FAST loading of photos and videos into thumbnails (loads about
  5 2.4 MB photos per second on a p4)
- FAST navigation while loading in background, preloading of
  surrounding thumbnails
- keyboard shortcuts for navigation and classifying
