                   [[ Themes in booh ]]

Each theme is made of:

- one index.html skeleton, used for the "index" page, the page
  showing the available subalbums (no such page in the generated
  album, if you don't have any subalbum)

- one thumbnails.html skeleton, used for the thumbnails page

- one image.html skeleton, used for fullscreen images

- any number of resource files these html pages depend on
  (images, css..), normally they should all go in the 'root'
  subdirectory, so that they are only copied in the root
  directory of the final webalbum and avoid wasting too much
  hosting space; they can be referred from the skeleton by
  prepending ~~pathtobase~~, which will be the relative path
  to the root directory of the final webalbum

- a metadata/parameters.rb file holding information about images
  sizes that will fit the best the html pages layout

- three metadata/screenshot-?.png files used to select theme in
  the GUI

If you want to create a new theme, or make local modifications to a
theme, just have them in your ~/.booh-themes directory. For example,
to hack off "dark":

# mkdir ~/.booh-themes
# cp -a /usr/share/booh/themes/dark ~/.booh-themes/mine

Use a different name than original theme names (here I picked the
dummy name "mine", choose a better one).


                  [[ Skeleton files ]]

The skeleton files contain keywords used in the backend to fill
them up with images. There is no precise documentation about
them, the best is to look at the 'simple' theme and learn from it
directly. Most of them are just a simple replace, and there are
two special cases:

- conditionals:

    ~~iffoo?~~bar~~fi~~

  indicates that if foo is true, put bar at this position, else
  put nothing; there are a few existing conditions tested, have a
  look in skeletons of the 'simple' theme

- loops:

   ~~iterate1_open~~
     foo
     ~~image_iteration~~
     bar
   ~~iterate1_close~~

   is used to put "foo" before each image (index and thumbnails
   pages only), and bar after each image

   It can be nested:

   ~~iterate1_open~~
      foo
       ~~iterate2_open_max4~~
         bar
         ~~image_iteration~~
         baz
       ~~iterate2_close~~
      qux
   ~~iterate1_close~~

   The character after "max" can be hardcoded, or can be "N" to
   represent the configurable number of images per rows in the
   thumbnails page. It indicates the amount of times iterate2
   will be performed before another iterate1 is needed.


                     [[ Screenshots ]]

Each theme must export three screenshots, used to select theme in
the GUI. First screenshot demonstrates the "index" page, second
one the "thumbnails" page, and third one the "image" page.

To keep a correct ratio between themes, to do your screenshot, be
sure to use the correct images sizes for your resolution; then
take the screenshot, crop for 1.55 aspect ratio and resize to 192
of width (thus 124 of height).

It would be best if the screenshots would show the same contents,
so just send me your theme if you create a new one and I'll do
the screenshots.
